# Java Layout and Algorithms

Java Layout and Algorithms is a Java program that demonstrates various data structures and algorithms. It includes sorting algorithms, data structure implementations, and search operations. The program utilizes the Java Swing library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the functionality.

## Java

Java is a popular object-oriented programming language known for its versatility, platform independence, and rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It provides a robust and reliable environment for developing a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile applications. Java's syntax and design principles make it easy to write, read, and maintain code.

## Java Swing

Java Swing is a part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that provides a set of GUI components and tools for building desktop applications in Java. It offers a comprehensive set of lightweight and customizable components such as buttons, labels, text fields, menus, and more. Swing provides a platform-independent approach to building GUI applications, ensuring that the applications look and feel consistent across different operating systems.

Swing follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating the application logic (controller) from the user interface (view) and the data (model). This separation allows for modular and maintainable code.

In the Java Layout and Algorithms program, Swing is used to create the graphical user interface, including windows, menus, buttons, labels, and layout managers. The GUI allows users to interact with the program's functionality and view the results of sorting and searching operations.

## Usage

To run the Java Layout and Algorithms program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java source code using the following command:

   ```
   javac balta_p8.java
   ```

3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```
   java balta_p8 <sort_file_location> <search_file_location>
   ```

   Replace `<sort_file_location>` with the location of the file containing the data to be sorted, and `<search_file_location>` with the location of the file containing the data to be searched.

## Program Features

The Java Layout and Algorithms program provides the following features:

- Sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort: Sorts the integers in the sort file using the Selection Sort algorithm.
- Data structures:
  - Binary Search Tree (BST): Adds integers from the sort file to a Binary Search Tree data structure.
  - TreeSet: Adds integers from the sort file to a TreeSet data structure.
  - PriorityQueue: Adds integers from the sort file to a PriorityQueue data structure.
  - HashSet: Adds integers from the sort file to a HashSet data structure.
  - ArrayList: Adds integers from the sort file to an ArrayList data structure.
  - Sorted ArrayList: Adds integers from the sort file to a Sorted ArrayList data structure.
  - Array: Adds integers from the sort file to an Array.
- Search operations:
  - Binary Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the sorted list of integers using the binary search algorithm.
  - BST Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the Binary Search Tree.
  - TreeSet Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the TreeSet.
  - PriorityQueue Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the PriorityQueue.
  - HashSet Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the HashSet.
  - ArrayList Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the ArrayList.
  - Sorted ArrayList Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the Sorted ArrayList.
  - Array Search: Searches for integers from the search file in the Array.

## File Input

The Java Layout and Algorithms program expects two input files:

-

 Sort file: Contains a list of integers to be sorted and added to the data structures.
- Search file: Contains a list of integers to be searched within the data structures.

Make sure to provide the correct file locations as command-line arguments when running the program.

## Program Interface

The Java Layout and Algorithms program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Java Swing. The GUI includes windows, menus, buttons, labels, and layout managers. It allows users to perform various operations such as reading the sort file, reading the search file, and executing sorting and searching operations on the data. The interface also displays the execution time for each operation, providing a visual representation of the program's performance.
